This DevOps Project deals with creation of Infrastructure using Terraform and setup of CICD Pipeline using Jenkins, Monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana and Log Aggregation using Loki, Promtail and Grafana. SonarQube was used for Code-Analysis and Maven was used as the Build Tool. Nexus Artifactory was used to keep the Artifacts as shown in the Architecture diagram above. Trivy was used for FileScan and Docker Image Scan. The Docker Image was kept in the Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and which was deployed to EKS Cluster using the ArgoCD as shown in the high-level architecture diagram above.
